## Description:
We make a simulation of iterative voting game and model voting agents as multiarmed bandit machines, learning under two different exploration strategies, and with tuned parameters.
Combining the feedback of multiple users on the relevance of coefficients in ”small n, large p” linear regression is beneficial in preventing overfitting in machine learning applications where the number of training samples is too small and the number of dimensions is too large.
